**Branch:** `BIM-400-flatten-root-project`  
**Date:** January 31, 2026

---

## What Changed

### Configuration Files
- **`config/settings/production.py`** — Added CORS whitelisting and domain validation (`bimflowsuite.com`, `api.bimflowsuite.com`)
- **`config/settings/common.py`** — Updated CORS middleware configuration
- **`config/settings/development.py`** — Enhanced development defaults
- **`config/settings/local.py`** — Minor updates for local flexibility

### Dependencies
- **`requirements/prod.txt`** — Added `gunicorn`, `whitenoise`, `psycopg2-binary`

### Documentation
- **`README.md`** — Expanded with production deployment guide and security configuration
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — New contributing guidelines (500+ lines)

### Cleanup
- **`release/designs/class_diagram.plantuml`** — Removed (replaced by markdown documentation)

---

## Why These Changes Were Made

### Security Hardening
Production deployment required explicit CORS and domain whitelisting to prevent:
- CSRF attacks via strict origin validation
- Host header injection attacks
- Unauthorized API requests from non-whitelisted domains

### Production Dependencies
Django development server is insufficient for production. Added:
- **`gunicorn`** — Production WSGI server (replaces development server)
- **`whitenoise`** — Efficient static file serving without S3 dependency
- **`psycopg2-binary`** — Explicit PostgreSQL support

### Deployment Documentation
Teams deploying to production lack clear setup instructions. Updated README with step-by-step production deployment guidance.

### Contributing Standards
GitHub-integrated contributing guidelines standardize development workflow, commit conventions, and PR/issue processes for team consistency.
